# Personal Finance Tracker

## Overview
The Personal Finance Tracker is a console-based application developed in C++ designed to help users monitor their financial activities efficiently. It serves as a practical tool for managing personal incomes and expenses, allowing for detailed categorization and analysis of financial transactions over time. This project showcases proficiency in file handling, object-oriented programming, and data manipulation within the C++ programming language.

## Features

### Add Income/Expense
Users can easily record their incomes and expenses by providing essential details such as the amount, date, and category of each transaction. This feature simplifies the process of tracking financial activities.

### Categorize Transactions
The application includes predefined categories for both income and expenses, such as Salary, Gifts, Groceries, and Utilities. Additionally, it offers the flexibility for users to create custom categories to suit their specific financial tracking needs.

### View Transactions
A comprehensive view of all transactions is available, with options to filter the list by type (income or expense), category, or date range. This feature aids users in reviewing their financial activities and making informed decisions.

### Summary Report
A summary report feature generates an overview of total income, total expenses, and net savings for a selected period. This report provides valuable insights into a user's financial health and helps track financial goals.

### Data Persistence
To ensure continuity and reliability, all transactions are saved in a file and loaded upon program startup. This data persistence mechanism guarantees that users' financial data is maintained between sessions, offering a seamless tracking experience.
